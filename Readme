# 📝 Task Manager API (Express + JSON File Storage)

This is a simple **Task Manager REST API** built with **Express.js**.  
Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`task.json`) and also cached in memory for fast access.  

You can:  
- Create tasks  
- Read tasks (all, by ID, or filter by completion)  
- Update tasks  
- Delete tasks  

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **In-memory store + persistent file storage**  
- ✅ **CRUD operations** (`Create, Read, Update, Delete`)  
- ✅ **Filter tasks** by completion (`completed=true` or `completed=false`)  
- ✅ **Auto-increment task IDs**  
- ✅ **Validation middleware** for request body  
- ✅ **404 handling** for invalid task IDs
